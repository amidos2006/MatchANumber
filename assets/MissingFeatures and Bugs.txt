- [Done] Biggest thing I would recommend adding is something like a simple first-play-intro tutorial rather than just having the "help" text.  
  The why: I purposely didn't explain the game to my girlfriend - 
  she missed the "help" option - started and was frustrated.  
  I didn't have the same problem, nor would most frequent gamers - however it is generally a good idea to be as inclusive as possible.  
  A slick example of a simple "intro tutorial" is the one in "Dots" (App Store) - have you seen that?  
  Once is fine, since the owner can explain to others how to play.
